# RocketChat-Bot
An example bot for RocketChat written in C# in the dotnet core framework

Since all I found was a NuGet package that didn't seem to work fully under dotnet core I decided to write my own bot for RocketChat.

This is very much still a work in progress but looking through the source code should give you an idea of how it works.
